# capyTerm

A simple and minimal terminal application for both SSH and local shell access, inspired by the simplicity of PuTTY and the aesthetics of Kitty.

## Features

- **Minimalist Tab Interface**: A clean, Kitty-like tabbed interface for managing multiple sessions within a single window.
- **Multi-Window Support**: Open multiple windows, each with its own set of tabs.
- **Connection Persistence**: Save your SSH connection details (host, port, auth method, etc.) for quick access.
